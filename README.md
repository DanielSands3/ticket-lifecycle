The ticket life-cycle begins with the end user. Here they can create a ticket adressing an issue or concern they would like to be assisted with. For example, Karen is noting she can't access the online banking site. Karen submits the ticket and the issue will now be handed over to the corresponding team.

Here, Jane responds to the end user updating them and keeping note of possible solutions. After further investigation Jane concludes the root cause of the issue is due to a software update, she uninstalls the update, fixes the system and notifies the end user that a solution has been reached. The end user is now able to access the Online Banking Portal.   <br />
